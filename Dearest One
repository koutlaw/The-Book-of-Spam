Dearest One.

I and my husband were from Kuwait, my husband worked with Kuwait embassy here in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died, he deposited the sum of US $2.5 million dollars in the bank of africa, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next eight months due to cancer, I decided to donate this fund to a some body that will use it in Gods work, help orphanages, widows, hospitals and charity organization, this decision was because i don't have any child that will inherit this money.

God bless you.
